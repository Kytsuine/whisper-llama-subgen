# whisper-llama-subgen
Project to use WhisperX to automatically transcribe subtitles, then revise the subtitles using LLaMa to predict misheard words
Currently, steps are sitting in Scripts folder waiting to be put together into a proper program. LLaMa and Bazarr api scripts are not yet finished, so this cannot be fully used. Provides example invocations of WhisperX and ffmpeg.
